Hey! Thanks for downloading the mod.

To add compatibility with this resource pack to any modded slabs, follow these directions:
1. Open the assets folder
2. Make a copy of the "mod_template" folder
3. Rename the copied folder to the mod's *codename*
If you don't know the mod's codename, enter a creative world with commands enabled and "/give" yourself the item. For example, if you did "/give @s slabsexpanded:acacia_log_slab", the mod's codename is "slabsexpanded"
4. Open the folder you just renamed, then open the "blockstates" folder
5. Rename the "modded_slab.json" file to whatever the name of the slab was in the /give command
So, in my instance, it would be "acacia_log_slab.json"
6. Open the renamed JSON file and change every instance of "modded_slab" with your modded block
In my instance, the file would look like this:

{
    "variants": {
        "type=bottom": { "model": "slabsexpanded:block/acacia_log_slab" },
        "type=top": { "model": "slabsexpanded:block/acacia_log_slab_top" },
        "type=double": { "model": "slabsexpanded:block/double_acacia_log_slab" }
    }
}

7. ***SAVE*** and close the JSON file
8. Leave the "blockstates" folder and now navigate to the "models" folder, then open the "blocks" folder inside of it
9. Same thing as the last JSON file; rename it to your modded block
In my instance, it would be "double_acacia_log_slab.json"
10. Open the JSON file and replace "modded_block" with the FULL-BLOCK VARIATION of your slab
This is because slab textures are tied to the full block's texture; slabs don't have their own texture.
For example, my file would look like this:

{
	"credit": "Created by Owehttamy",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_all",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_column",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_mirror",
	"textures": {
		"all": "minecraft:block/acacia_log"
		"side": "minecraft:block/acacia_log",
		"end": "minecraft:block/acacia_log_top"
	}
}

NOT like this:

{
	"credit": "Created by Owehttamy",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_all",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_column",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_mirror",
	"textures": {
		"all": "minecraft:block/acacia_log_slab"
		"side": "minecraft:block/acacia_log_slab",
		"end": "minecraft:block/acacia_log_slab_top"
	}
}

11. Now, we need to tell the game how we want it to change how the slab appears. We will do this by telling the game to use preset models—or "parent" models—that I've created.
If you don't care about understanding what exactly you're doing, just skip to step 11a.
A very important note is that you can only tell the game to use one parent model, because otherwise, you're giving the game multiple different directions of how to change the block's model, and it will become confused. In short, every model in Minecraft lost one of their parents in a tragic car accident, and they absolutely will NOT allow their remaining parent to get remarried.
Also, if your block has only one texture on all sides, we're going to be removing the "side" and "end" lines because we only need to tell it the "all" texture, not what's on the *sides* and *ends* (top and bottom) of the block.
If your block is a column and has two different textures, we're gonna remove the "all" line, because there is not one single texture that covers *all* sides of the block.

11a. If the block has the same texture on all sides of the block and you want the texture to be rotated 90° when it's a double slab, keep reading this step. If not, go to step 11b.
Remove the following lines:  **MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE LINES OF TEXT**

	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_column",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_mirror",
		"side": "mod_name:block/modded_block",
		"end": "mod_name:block/modded_block_top"

The file should look like this:

{
	"credit": "Created by Owehttamy",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_all",
	"textures": {
		"all": "mod_name:block/modded_block"
	}
}

Once done, skip to step 12.

11b. If the block is a "column" block, and has two different textures—one on the top and bottom, and another on the sides, keep reading this step. If not, go to step 11c.
Remove the following lines:  **MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE LINES OF TEXT**

	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_all",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_mirror",
		"all": "mod_name:block/modded_block"

The file should look like this:

{
	"credit": "Created by Owehttamy",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_column",
	"textures": {
		"side": "mod_name:block/modded_block",
        "end": "mod_name:block/modded_block_top"
	}
}

Once done, skip to step 12.

11c. If the block has the same texture on all sides of the block and you want the block's texture to be mirrored when it's a double slab, remove the following lines:  **MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE LINES OF TEXT**

	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_all",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_column",
		"side": "mod_name:block/modded_block",
		"end": "mod_name:block/modded_block_top"

The file should look like this:

{
	"credit": "Created by Owehttamy",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_mirror",
	"textures": {
		"all": "mod_name:block/modded_block"
	}
}

12. If your slab is based on a modded block, change the part that says "mod_name:" on the fifth line of the file to the mod's codename. If your modded slab is based on a block from the vanilla game, like the one I've used in the above examples, change that part to "minecraft:".
This is because the game needs to know where the block's texture is in the files, and it will look in Minecraft's files (or in another incorrect place) instead of the mod's, which won't work.
For example:

{
	"credit": "Created by Owehttamy",
	"parent": "dds:block/parent_double_slab_column",
	"textures": {
		"side": "stoneexpansion:block/cut_bricks",
		"end": "stoneexpansion:block/cut_bricks_top"
	}
}


13. Save the file, then press F3 and T simultaneously to have Minecraft reload the resource pack to see if the changes work. If they didn't, don't hesitate to contact me on Discord: @owehttamy (Please reach out on Discord if you have issues. There's a high chance that I explained something poorly or the mod you're trying to add support to is formatted poorly, which isn't your fault.)

If you end up adding full support for a mod to this resource pack, contact me on Discord: @owehttamy
I'd love to add it to the base resource pack to make other people's lives easier! And I'd, of course, credit you in the process :)

Okay, you get the deal. Have fun! :)
